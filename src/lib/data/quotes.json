  "Look down on the flesh, for it is passing away; take care of the soul, for it is something immortal.",
  "If you want storehouses, you have them in the stomachs of the poor. Lay up for yourself treasure in heaven.",
  "You are guilty of injustice towards as many as you might have aided, and did not.",
  "Strive to attain to the greater virtues, but do not neglect the lesser ones.",
  "I admire your proposing questions not for the sake of testing, as many now do, but to discover the truth itself.",
  "A good deed is never lost; he who sows courtesy reaps friendship, and he who plants kindness gathers love.",
  "Likeness to God, however, cannot be had without knowledge, and knowledge comes from teaching.",
  "Never place yourself above anyone, not even great sinners.",
  "Humility often saves a sinner who has committed many grievous transgressions.",
  "Does not the gratitude of the dog put to shame any man who is ungrateful to his benefactors?",

  "Prayer is a request for what is good, offered by the devout of God.",
  "Anger is inebriation of the soul, making it deranged, just as wine does.",

  "The human being is an animal who has received the vocation to become God.",
  "It is not he who begins well who is perfect. It is he who ends well who is approved in God's sight.",
  "There is still time for endurance, time for patience, time for healing, time for change. Have you slipped? Rise up. Have you sinned? Cease.",
  "Envy is distress caused by your neighbor's prosperity. The jealous person is never free from anguish, never free from despair.",
  "There is no other passion engendered in human souls more pernicious than envy. As rust eats away at iron, so envy eats away at the soul in which it lives.",
  "Troubles are usually the brooms and shovels that smooth the road to a good man's fortune.",
  "Many a man curses the rain that falls upon his head, and knows not that it brings abundance to drive away the hunger.",
  "As the pilot of a vessel is tried in the storm; as the wrestler is tried in the ring, the soldier in the battle, and the hero in adversity: so is the Christian tried in temptation.",
  "I want creation to penetrate you with so much admiration that everywhere, wherever you may be, the least plant may bring to you the clear remembrance of the Creator.",
  "Oh, God, enlarge within us the sense of fellowship with all living things, our brothers the animals to whom Thou gavest the earth in common with us.",
  "For if we all took only what was necessary to satisfy our own needs, giving the rest to those who lack, no one would be rich, no one would be poor, and no one would be in need.",
  "Is not the person who strips another of clothing called a thief? And those who do not clothe the naked when they have the power to do so, should they not be called the same?",
  "Whoever has the ability to remedy the suffering of others, but chooses rather to withhold aid out of selfish motives, may properly be judged the equivalent of a murderer.",
  "God does not love what is constrained but what is accomplished out of virtue. And virtue comes into being out of free choice and not out of constraint.",
  "Every divine action begins from the Father, proceeds through the Son, and is completed in the Holy Spirit.",
  "Let us fast an acceptable and very pleasing fast to the Lord. True fasting is the estrangement from evil, temperance of tongue, abstinence from anger, separation from desires, slander, falsehood and perjury.",
  "Fasting sends prayer up into heaven, becoming like wings for its upward journey.",
  "Any part of the Scriptures you like to choose is inspired by God. The Holy Spirit composed the Scriptures so that in them, as in a pharmacy open to all souls, we might each of us be able to find the medicine suited to our own particular illness.",
  "When someone steals another's clothes, we call them a thief. Should we not give the same name to one who could clothe the naked and does not? The bread in your cupboard belongs to the hungry; the coat unused in your closet belongs to the one who needs it; the shoes rotting in your closet belong to the one who has no shoes; the money which you hoard up belongs to the poor.",
  "The bread which you hold back is for the hungry, the clothes you keep put away are for the naked, the shoes that are rotting away with disuse are for those who have none, the silver you keep buried in the earth is for the needy. You are thus guilty of injustice toward as many as you might have aided, and did not.",
  "The bread which you do not use is the bread of the hungry; the garment hanging in your wardrobe is the garment of him who is naked; the shoes that you do not wear are the shoes of the one who is barefoot; the money that you keep locked away is the money of the poor; the acts of charity that you do not perform are so many injustices that you commit.",
  "When I go into the house of one of these tasteless newly rich individuals, and see it bedecked with every imaginable hue, I know that this person possesses nothing more valuable than what is on display; such people decorate inanimate objects, but fail to beautify the soul.",
  "I know many who fast, pray, sigh, and demonstrate every manner of piety, so long as it costs them nothing, yet would not part with a penny to help those in distress.",
  "You showed no mercy; it will not be shown to you. You opened not your house; you will be expelled from the Kingdom. You gave not your bread; you will not receive eternal life.",
  "Preserve gratitude like a precious deposit within your soul, and from it you will receive a double portion of delight.",
  "Care for the needy requires the expenditure of wealth: when all share alike, disbursing their possessions among themselves, they each receive a small portion for their individual needs. Thus, those who love their neighbor as themselves possess nothing more than their neighbor; yet surely, you seem to have great possessions! How else can this be, but that you have preferred your own enjoyment to the consolation of the many?",
  "Had you clothed the naked, had you given your bread to the hungry, had your door been open to every stranger, had you been a parent to the orphan, had you made the suffering of every helpless person your own, what money would you have left, the loss of which to grieve?",
  "First, let me say that we have already received from God the ability to fulfil all his commands. We have then no reason to resent them, as if something beyond our capacity were being asked of us.",
  "Love of God is not something that can be taught. We did not learn from someone else how to rejoice in light or want to live, or to love our parents or guardians. It is the same with our love for God: it does not come by another's teaching.",
  "Evil consists in estrangement from God. With a small turning of the eye, we are either facing the sun or facing the shadow of our own body. Thus one who looks upward easily finds illumination, but for one who turns toward the shadow darkening is inevitable.",
  "What then will you answer the Judge? You gorgeously array your walls, but do not clothe your fellow human being; you adorn horses, but turn away from the shameful plight of your brother or sister; you allow grain to rot in your barns, but do not feed those who are starving; you hide gold in the earth, but ignore the oppressed!",
  "When wealth is scattered in the manner which our Lord directed, it naturally returns, but when it is gathered, it naturally disperses. If you try to keep it, you will not have it; if you scatter it, you will not lose it.",
  "It befits those who possess sound judgment to recognize that they have received wealth as a stewardship, and not for their own enjoyment; thus, when they are parted from it, they rejoice as those who relinquish what is not really theirs.",
  "You are not disappointed when you must spend gold in order to purchase a horse. But when you have the opportunity to exchange corruptible things for the Kingdom of Heaven, you shed tears, spurning the one who asks of you and refusing to give anything.",
  "Are you poor? You know someone who is even poorer. You have provisions for only ten days, but someone else has only enough for one day. As a good and generous person, redistribute your surplus to the needy. Do not shrink from giving the little that you have.",
  "Give but a little, and you will gain much; undo the primal sin by sharing your food. Just as Adam transmitted sin by eating wrongfully, so we wipe away the treacherous food when we remedy the need and hunger of our brothers and sisters.",
  "In anticipation, therefore, prepare yourself for your own burial. Works of piety are an excellent burial garment. Make your departure dressed in the full regalia of your good deeds; convert your wealth into a truly inseparable adornment; keep everything with you when you go!",
  "When you are about to give to a poor person on the Lord's account, that same gift is also a loan: it is a gift because you do not hope to receive it back again, but a loan because the Master in his great beneficence undertakes to make repayment for the poor person.",
  "First it said that God indeed created; in what follows it also says how he created. For if it simply said that he created, you would have thought that he created us in the same way as the domestic animals, as the wild beasts, as the plants, as the grass.",
  "He did not say, as with the others, 'Let there be a human being.' Learn well your own dignity.",
  "The sheep was created to go to pasture, it has its head inclining downward, looking at the stomach. But the human being no longer looks toward the stomach, but his head is lifted high toward things above, that he may look up to what is akin to him.",
  "First the power to rule was conferred on you. O human, you are a ruling being. And why do you serve the passions as a slave? Why do you throw away your own dignity and become a slave of sin?",
  "So do not ever allow your mind, reduced to utter slavery, to become a slave of the passions; moreover, do not yield to the passions struggling against reason and let them transfer to themselves the rule of the soul.",
  "When you see these rulers, preceded by a herald with an uplifted voice, do not fear what you see. Take to heart that God molded the human being, dust from the earth. If he is something else, fear him, but if he is dust from the earth, despise him.",
  "Be attentive, then, to yourself, that you may also receive the aid of healing proportionate to your offense. If the sin is great and severe, you need many confessions, bitter tears, earnestness in vigils, continual fasting.",
  "For in truth it is the height of inhumanity that those who do not have enough even for basic necessities should be compelled to seek a loan in order to survive, while others should turn the misfortune of the poor to their own advantage."
